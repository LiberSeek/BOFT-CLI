# Linux support

BOFT CLI supports x64 and ARM64 Linux through the npm package. Install the official ChatGPT App matching the current architecture first, then install BOFT CLI:

```bash
npm install --global @liberseek/boft-cli
boft
```

## Supported environment

The Linux release supports the official ChatGPT `.deb` and `.rpm` packages on x86-64 and ARM64. The BOFT CLI Linux native binaries use glibc 2.35 as their release baseline and can load on systems with glibc 2.35 or newer; the official ChatGPT App's distribution support remains defined by OpenAI's documentation. BOFT CLI verifies the production package metadata, native ELF architecture, and these packaged entry points:

- launcher: `/usr/bin/chatgpt`
- installation: `/usr/lib/chatgpt`
- Desktop executable: `/usr/lib/chatgpt/ChatGPT`

The runtime requires a mounted `/proc` and Linux `pidfd` support. Snap, Flatpak, AppImage, local or relocated installations, wrapper or `alternatives` launchers, cross-architecture execution, and BOFT CLI Linux installer packages are not supported. BOFT CLI is installed and updated through npm on Linux.

## Renderer compatibility

Renderer integration failures are recovered in the background and do not display compatibility dialogs or write local warning acknowledgements. While an external Agent integration is unavailable, the managed Desktop remains usable with official Codex routing. The initial Controller handshake still fails closed on malformed or unsupported readiness output.

## Process ownership

BOFT CLI refuses to take over an independently running ChatGPT App. Quit ChatGPT completely before launching `boft`. A managed launch starts the verified Desktop executable directly and supervises it through `/proc`; stock ChatGPT launches still use the official launcher. Shutdown signals are sent only after PID, start time, and executable identity are revalidated.

## Diagnosis

```bash
boft inspect
boft --version
```

`inspect` reports the recognized package identity, version, launcher, executable, and running process IDs. After a ChatGPT App update, use it to confirm that BOFT CLI still recognizes the installed Desktop. Renderer integration retries automatically when a supported surface is temporarily unavailable.
